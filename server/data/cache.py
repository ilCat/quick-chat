    "Hi": "Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ How can I help you today?",
    "Hello": "Hello! Ready to chat about anything you'd like.",
    "How are you?": "I'm just a bunch of code, but I'm doing great! How about you?",
    "What's your name?": "I'm your friendly AI assistant. You can call me whatever you like!",
    "What can you do?": "I can help answer questions, explain concepts, and even chat for fun. Ask me anything!",
    "Nice to meet you": "Nice to meet you too! ðŸ˜Š",
    "Thank you": "You're welcome!",
    "Thanks": "Anytime!",
    "Tell me a joke": "Why do not robots ever panic? Because they always keep their *cool* circuits!",

    "What is artificial intelligence?": "Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science focused on building systems that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and perception.",
    "What is a language model?": "A language model is a system that predicts the probability of word sequences. Large language models like GPT can generate coherent text and answer questions.",
    "What is generative AI?": "Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence capable of creating new contentâ€”such as text, images, music, or codeâ€”based on existing data.",
    "What is machine learning?": "Machine learning is a branch of AI that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed.",
    "What is deep learning?": "Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers to model complex patterns in data.",
    "Who created ChatGPT?": "ChatGPT was developed by OpenAI, a research organization focused on advancing artificial intelligence.",
    "What is an LLM?": "LLM stands for Large Language Model. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language.",
    "What is natural language processing (NLP)?": "NLP is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret, and generate human language.",
    "What is a prompt?": "A prompt is the input given to a language model to generate a response, such as a question or instruction.",
    "What are the risks of AI?": "Risks of AI include misinformation, job displacement, algorithmic bias, and lack of transparency in automated systems.",
